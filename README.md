# Whole food soylent

A Soylent calculator written in Python.

This was used to create [this recipe][1], more fully described [here][2].
It is a whole-food, lactose-free soylent slice that approximately meets Rob Rinehart's RDI for an adult male.
If you substitute your own, the following estimates may be useful:

*protein*
 - 0.8g of protein per kg of body weight

*oil*
 - use a combination of oils
 - Omega-6 and omega-3 FA should be in a ratio 3:1
 - avoid excess arachodonic acid

*fibre*
 - 14g per 1000 kcal

*other notes*
 - try a mixture of fish oil, evoo and canola 1:1:2
 - egg yolks contain 2/3 daily cholesterol, limit 1 per day
 - try to get as many micronutrients from fortified ingredients to reduce cost
 - finely ground eggshell can be used as a calcium supplement

## Optional extras

*muscle*
 - 5g creatine w/ 70g maltodextrin before exercise

*nootropic*
 - 2mg piracetam w/ 500mg choline before work OR 1 cup coffee
